## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing consumer behavior using a dataset of purchases. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and building a simple predictive model. The goal is to derive insights into purchasing patterns and measure customer loyalty across different demographics.

## Key Features
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
   - Handle missing values and standardize data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Generate basic statistics and explore missing data.
   - Understand patterns and trends in the dataset.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - Create graphs to show insights such as:
     - Which product categories perform better in specific seasons.
     - Loyalty scores across different age groups.

4. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Build a regression model to predict purchase amounts.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## Folder Structure
- **Data**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **Code**: Includes scripts for data preprocessing, EDA, visualization, and modeling.
- **Graph**: Stores generated graphs and visualizations.
- **README.md**: Provides a summary of the project.
